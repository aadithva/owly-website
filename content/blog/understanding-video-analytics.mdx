## Beyond Views and Impressions

View counts feel good but tell you almost nothing about whether a video ad is working. The metrics that actually drive decisions are more specific: hook rate (what percentage of viewers watch past the first 3 seconds), hold rate (how much of the video people actually watch), click-through rate, and ultimately cost per acquisition. Understanding the relationship between these metrics is what separates data-informed creative teams from those just chasing vanity numbers.

## The Metrics That Matter at Each Stage

Different metrics matter at different stages of the funnel. At the top, hook rate and thumb-stop ratio tell you if your creative is earning attention. In the middle, hold rate and completion rate reveal whether your message is landing. At the bottom, click-through rate and conversion rate show if you are driving action. Teams that track all three stages can diagnose exactly where an ad is failing instead of guessing. A high hook rate but low completion rate means the opening works but the message does not sustain interest.

## Using Data to Improve Creative

The real value of analytics is not reporting. It is feedback. When teams on Owly review performance data alongside their storyboards, they start seeing patterns. Maybe product-first openings outperform lifestyle openings for their brand. Maybe 15-second versions convert better than 30-second versions on a specific platform. These insights compound over time and become a genuine competitive advantage that is hard for competitors to replicate.

## Common Mistakes in Video Analytics

The most common mistake is optimizing for the wrong metric. Optimizing for views or impressions can lead to clickbait-style creative that attracts attention but does not convert. Another frequent error is drawing conclusions from too little data. Video ad performance is noisy, and teams need sufficient volume before declaring a winner. Finally, ignoring platform-specific differences leads to poor decisions. A video that works on Instagram Reels may underperform on YouTube Shorts because the audience behavior and context are fundamentally different.
